      ASP.NET Core is a free, open-source and cloud optimized web framework which can run on Windows, Linux, or Mac. You can say that it is the new version of ASP.NET. The framework is a complete rewrite from scratch in order to make it open source, modular and cross-platform. It was initially launched as ASP.NET 5 but then it was renamed to ASP.NET Core.
